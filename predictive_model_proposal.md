# Donor Upgrade Prediction Model Proposal

## Overview
We can enhance the current upgrade analysis with machine learning to predict which donors are most likely to increase their contributions.

## Key Features for Prediction
1. Historical donation patterns:
   - Donation growth rate
   - Seasonal patterns
   - Response to previous upgrade requests

2. Donor engagement metrics:
   - Communication response rates
   - Event participation
   - Website/email interaction data

3. External factors:
   - Time of year
   - Economic indicators
   - Campaign timing

## Technical Implementation
1. Use scikit-learn for:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Feature importance analysis

2. Model evaluation metrics:
   - Precision (avoid false positives)
   - Recall (identify most potential upgraders)
   - ROC-AUC score

## Data Requirements
To implement this, we would need:
1. At least 12 months of historical donation data
2. Previous upgrade request outcomes
3. Donor interaction history
4. Campaign response data

## Expected Benefits
1. More accurate upgrade targeting
2. Personalized ask amounts
3. Better timing for upgrade requests
4. ROI optimization for fundraising efforts
